**How to work with the database MongoDB**

At least you have to create an account on MongoDB Atlas and get a cluster

- URL to connect to the DB -> mongodb+srv://(username):(password)@cluster0.1whhc.mongodb.net/(appName)?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Each word have to be replaced by your credentials (save them carefully ! ðŸš¨)
